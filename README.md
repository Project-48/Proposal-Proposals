# Proposal-Proposals
A Repo for managing proposed proposals.

Essentially, before starting a new Proposal in full, a general outline of the preposal and what it's meant to cover and what it's not meant to cover should occour. While this can change later on, (proposals can be combined, split, or expand in scope,) it is to be considred best practace to have a outline before starting work in earnest.
